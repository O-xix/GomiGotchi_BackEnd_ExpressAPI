# GomiGotchi – Backend API (UWB Hacks 2025)

This repository contains the **backend API** for **GomiGotchi**, a gamified litter-cleanup mobile app created during **UWB Hacks 2025** (theme: *Save the World*).  

## 📖 Project Overview
The backend provides a secure **REST API** and database layer for the GomiGotchi app.  
- Handles user accounts, session tracking, and cleanup activity logs  
- Stores and retrieves pet state data (health, happiness) linked to environmental actions  
- Connects the frontend (React + Leaflet) to **MongoDB** for persistent storage  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Node.js** + **Express.js** – REST API server  
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for user/pet data  
- **Mongoose** – schema modeling and database queries  

## 📝 Features (Prototype)
- **User Management**: sign up, login, authentication  
- **Pet Data**: store and retrieve pet status (hunger, health, activity)  
- **Cleanup Logs**: track litter collection events tied to user accounts  
- **API Endpoints**: JSON responses consumed by the React frontend  

## 🔑 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Backend development with **Express.js**  
- Database design and schema modeling in **MongoDB**  
- REST API creation and integration with frontend services  
- Team-based rapid prototyping in a hackathon environment  

## 📌 Note
This repo contains the **backend prototype only**. The project was built collaboratively in a 5-person team during a 36-hour hackathon, and is not production-ready.
